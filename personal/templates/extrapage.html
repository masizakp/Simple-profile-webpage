      <p><h1>The first School I've worked in is Meetsetshehla Secondary School</h1></p>
      Our school was founded by Dr. Peter Farrant in 1986. It was built by Dr. Farrant and initially started as a farm school on his land. 
      It was the only High School for black learners of farm workers in the Waterberg District.
      In those years only Primary Farm Schools were allowed by the Government but after several petitions from the
      farming community, an exception was made to give Dr Farrant permission to build a High School provided that it was built on his land. 
      No state land would be made available at the time. This was the beginning of a Public Private Partnership. 
      Meetsetshehla Secondary School is a public school on private land.
      In the meantime the Northern Education Trust (NET) was established. Dr Farrant donated his land and the buildings to the NET. The NET, 
      apart from being the owner of the land, is responsible for raising funds both internationally and locally in order to establish a modern 
      school with all the facilities for providing excellent education.
      We are very grateful today to have a fully fledged hospitality and catering facility with kitchen and restaurant, a modern Science Laboratory, two Computer Centres, 
      a Mechanical Technology Centre and excellent sporting facilities including a gymnasium. Our focus always has been to provide quality education for the poorest of the poor.
      Apart from an academic field of study we also focus on vocational education, offering subjects like Hospitality Studies, Tourism, 
      Agricultural Technology and Computer Application Technology.
      These subjects provide learners the opportunity to further their studies, but also to find jobs in the local Tourism industry after they have left school.
      We are very proud of the achievements of former learners. Many of them are pursuing a professional career. Several doctors, engineers, physiotherapists, lawyers, accountants are amongst the learners who completed their school career at Meetsetshehla Secondary School.
      Many of our former learners are currently employed in the Tourism Industry, local NGOâ€™s and in State Departments.
      We are currently focusing on an extensive Mathematics and English bridging programme for our grade 8 and 9 learners. The NET is supporting the school with fundraising to provide additional educators and learner support material to meet these challenges.
      We acknowledge the importance of leadership development. Our school has taken the initiative in this regard. Three years ago we started an intensive learner leadership development programme.
      Our school is managed on Christian principles.
